Weather Data Program
Original: December 2011
Updated: March 2013

This was my final project for Intro to Computer Science at Smith College. It was originally written in Python 2.3 and is now updated to run in Python 2.7.

The program takes data from metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/stationdata to answer questions about weather in England. Specifics of the questions are detailed in the documentation in the code.
